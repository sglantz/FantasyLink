======

Helping you over-analyze you fantasy baseball team since 2012.

What is FantasyLink?
------

FantasyLink is a Chrome browser extension that integrates FanGraphs and Baseball Reference directly into your fantasy baseball league website.

Do I need it?
------

Do you play fantasy baseball? Is your league site run on CBSSports.com or ESPN.com? Do you often find yourself unimpressed with the stats that those sites provide you? Do you think xFIP has more predictive value then ERA? If you answered yes to these questions, you probably spend a little to much time switching back and forth between your league website and more in depth baseball sites like FanGraphs or Baseball Reference. This extension is designed to cut down on that wasted time.

How does it work?
------

FantasyLink scans through your league's team clubhouse, free agency, and trade pages looking in specific places for player names. Whenever a player is found, the extension inserts a link to that player's profile on FanGraphs and/or Baseball Reference (you can adjust the sites in the extension's setting). You end up with a page that might look something like this: ![FantasyLink Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/fOAY0Wc.jpg "FantasyLink Screenshot") 

Now looking up Mike Napoli's BABIP is as easy as clicking the little FanGraphs logo next to his name

I'm sold, now how do I get it?

FantasyLink is available for download in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fantasylink/pghfoglbgdeknkjcmilhkidfdkgenfdi).  If you know javascript and want to tinker with the extension's code, you can fork the project on [Github](https://github.com/sglantz/FantasyGraph-Chrome-Extension).
